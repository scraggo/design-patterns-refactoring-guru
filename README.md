[refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) is an excellent outline of what object-oriented (OOP) design patterns are and goes into incredible depth into how they work. I chose make their TypeScript examples editable and run-able. This has been a great aid to my learning of this topic and TypeScript.

## Usage

`npm start` - see console output for all design patterns

`npm start -- -n <Design Pattern Name>` - see console output for `<Design Pattern Name>` (if found)

`npm run start-name -- <Design Pattern Name>` - (same as above)
